1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I wake up in the morning and I want to reach for my phone,

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,800
but I know that even if I were to crank up the brightness

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,040
on that phone screen,

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,320
it's not bright enough to trigger that cortisol spike.

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,120
And for me to be at my most alert and focused

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,200
throughout the day and to optimize my sleep at night.

7
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:24,080
So what I do is I get out of bed and I go outside.

8
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,400
And if it's a bright, clear day,

9
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,240
and the sun is low in the sky,

10
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,240
or the sun is starting to get overhead,

11
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,759
what we call low solar angle,

12
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:35,799
then I know I'm getting outside at the right time.

13
00:00:35,799 --> 00:00:38,840
If there's cloud cover and I can't see the sun,

14
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,439
I also know I'm doing a good thing

15
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:42,599
because it turns out, especially on cloudy days,

16
00:00:42,599 --> 00:00:44,720
you want to get outside and get as much light energy

17
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,459
or photons in your eyes.

18
00:00:46,459 --> 00:00:48,360
But let's say it's a very clear day

19
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,480
and I can see where the sun is.

20
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,279
I do not need to stare directly into the sun.

21
00:00:53,279 --> 00:00:56,240
If it's very low in the sky, I might do that

22
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,560
because it's not going to be very painful to my eyes.

23
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,080
However, if the sun is a little bit brighter

24
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,560
and a little bit higher in the sky,

25
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,239
sometimes it can be painful to look at.

26
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,959
So the way to get this sunlight viewing early in the day

27
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:10,639
is to look toward the sun.

28
00:01:10,639 --> 00:01:12,980
If it's too bright to look at directly,

29
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:13,959
well then don't do that.

30
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:16,239
You just look toward it, but not directly at it.

31
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:18,400
It's absolutely fine to blink.

32
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,680
In fact, I encourage you to blink

33
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,120
whenever you feel the impulse to blink.

34
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,860
Never look at any light, sunlight or otherwise,

35
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,540
that's so bright that it's painful to look at

36
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,180
because you can damage your eyes.

37
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:30,500
But for this morning sunlight viewing,

38
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,540
it's best to not wear sunglasses.

39
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:34,919
That's right, to not wear sunglasses,

40
00:01:34,919 --> 00:01:37,660
at least for this morning sunlight viewing.

41
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:42,300
It is absolutely fine to wear eyeglasses or contact lenses,

42
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,419
so-called corrective lenses.

43
00:01:43,419 --> 00:01:46,500
In fact, those will serve you well in this practice

44
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,379
or this tool because they will focus the light

45
00:01:48,379 --> 00:01:50,339
onto your neural retina and onto those melanopsin

46
00:01:50,339 --> 00:01:52,419
intrinsically photosensitive ganglion cells.

47
00:01:52,419 --> 00:01:56,820
If your eyeglasses or contact lenses have UV protection,

48
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:57,980
that's okay.

49
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:59,419
There's so many different wavelengths of light

50
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:02,099
coming from the sun and they are bright enough

51
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:03,779
that they will trigger the mechanisms

52
00:02:03,779 --> 00:02:07,580
that you want triggered at this early time of day.

53
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:09,259
So try and get outside,

54
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:11,059
ideally within the first five minutes of waking,

55
00:02:11,059 --> 00:02:12,899
or maybe it's 15 minutes,

56
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:15,460
but certainly within the first hour after waking.

57
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,580
I want to share with you three critical things

58
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,940
about this tool of morning sunlight viewing.

59
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:23,740
First of all, this is not some woo biology thing.

60
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:26,660
This is grounded in the core of our physiology.

61
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:27,940
There are literally hundreds,

62
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,259
if not thousands of quality peer reviewed papers

63
00:02:30,259 --> 00:02:33,699
showing that light viewing early in the day

64
00:02:33,699 --> 00:02:35,419
is the most powerful stimulus

65
00:02:35,419 --> 00:02:36,899
for wakefulness throughout the day.

66
00:02:36,899 --> 00:02:39,539
And it has a powerful positive impact

67
00:02:39,539 --> 00:02:41,660
on your ability to fall and stay asleep at night.

68
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:44,619
So this is really the foundational power tool

69
00:02:44,619 --> 00:02:47,220
for ensuring a great night's sleep

70
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,779
and for feeling more awake during the day.

71
00:02:50,619 --> 00:02:54,259
Second of all, if you wake up before the sun is out,

72
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:59,020
you can and probably should flip on artificial lights

73
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:01,419
in your internal home environment or apartment

74
00:03:01,419 --> 00:03:02,820
or wherever you happen to live,

75
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,660
if your goal is to be awake, right?

76
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:05,779
If you wake up at four in the morning

77
00:03:05,779 --> 00:03:06,660
and you need to be awake,

78
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,179
well then turn on artificial lights.

79
00:03:09,179 --> 00:03:13,259
Once the sun is out, however, once the sun has risen,

80
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:16,000
then you still want to get outside and view sunlight.

81
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:19,919
Some of you will wake up before the sun comes out.

82
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:22,199
And if you're asking whether or not

83
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:23,360
turning on artificial lights

84
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,440
can replace sunlight at those hours,

85
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,520
unfortunately, the answer is no.

86
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,199
Unless you have a very special light,

87
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:31,960
we'll talk about what kind of light,

88
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,960
the bright artificial lights in your home environment

89
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,559
are not, I repeat,

90
00:03:36,559 --> 00:03:38,880
are not going to be sufficiently bright

91
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,839
to turn on the cortisol mechanism

92
00:03:41,839 --> 00:03:43,380
and the other wake up mechanisms

93
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,720
that you need early in the day.

94
00:03:46,399 --> 00:03:47,320
The diabolical twist, however,

95
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,080
is that those lights in your home or apartment

96
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,080
or even on your phone are bright enough

97
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:56,119
to disrupt your sleep if you look at them too late at night

98
00:03:56,119 --> 00:03:57,360
or in the middle of the night.

99
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,300
So there's this asymmetry in our retinal,

100
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:03,240
our eye biology and in our brain's biology,

101
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,259
whereby early in the day, right around waking,

102
00:04:05,259 --> 00:04:07,720
you need a lot of light, a lot of photons,

103
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,080
a lot of light energy and artificial lights

104
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,080
generally just won't accomplish

105
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,600
what you need them to accomplish.

106
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,640
But at night, even a little bit of artificial light

107
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,119
can really mess up your so-called circadian,

108
00:04:19,119 --> 00:04:20,480
your 24 hour clocks

109
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,559
and all these mechanisms that we're talking about.

110
00:04:22,559 --> 00:04:24,380
So if you wake up before the sun is out

111
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,679
and it's still dark,

112
00:04:25,679 --> 00:04:28,320
please turn on as many bright artificial lights

113
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,440
as you possibly can or need,

114
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,559
but then get outside once the sun is out.

115
00:04:33,559 --> 00:04:37,119
On cloudy days, you especially need to get outside.

116
00:04:37,119 --> 00:04:39,359
I repeat, on cloudy days, overcast days,

117
00:04:39,359 --> 00:04:41,440
you especially need to get outside and get sunlight.

118
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,880
You just need to get more of it.

119
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,160
Now, how much light and how much light viewing do you need?

120
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,359
This is going to vary depending on person and place,

121
00:04:49,359 --> 00:04:51,000
literally where you live on earth,

122
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,079
whether or not there's a lot of tree cover,

123
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:54,880
whether or not you're somebody who has sensitive eyes

124
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,119
or less sensitive eyes.

125
00:04:56,119 --> 00:04:57,359
It's really impossible for me

126
00:04:57,359 --> 00:04:59,179
to give an absolute prescriptive,

127
00:04:59,179 --> 00:05:00,899
but we can give some general guidelines.

128
00:05:00,899 --> 00:05:02,880
In general, on a clear day,

129
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,720
meaning no cloud cover or minimal cloud cover,

130
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:09,679
you want to get this sunlight exposure to your eyes

131
00:05:09,679 --> 00:05:12,279
for about five minutes or so.

132
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:14,160
Could be three minutes one day, could be seven minutes

133
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,920
the next day, about five minutes.

134
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,260
On a day where there's cloud cover,

135
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:21,079
so the sun is just peeking through the clouds

136
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:23,339
or it's more dense cloud cover,

137
00:05:23,339 --> 00:05:26,899
you want to get about 10 minutes of sunlight exposure

138
00:05:26,899 --> 00:05:28,359
to your eyes early in the day.

139
00:05:28,359 --> 00:05:30,799
And on days that are really densely overcast

140
00:05:30,799 --> 00:05:32,119
or maybe even a rainy,

141
00:05:32,119 --> 00:05:35,279
you're going to want to get as much as 20 or 30 minutes

142
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:37,320
of sunlight exposure.

143
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,920
Another key thing is do not forget about,

144
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,679
just don't try and get this sunlight exposure

145
00:05:43,679 --> 00:05:46,640
through a windshield of a car or a window,

146
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,079
whether or not it's tinted or otherwise.

147
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:49,640
It takes far too long.

148
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,739
It's simply not going to trigger the relevant mechanisms.

149
00:05:52,739 --> 00:05:54,040
You would be standing there all day

150
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,799
trying to get enough light into your eyes

151
00:05:55,799 --> 00:05:56,720
from the morning sunlight.

152
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,920
And by then the sun will have already moved

153
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,940
from low solar angle to overhead.

154
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:03,040
And it simply won't work for all sorts of mechanisms

155
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,179
related to your circadian rhythm functions.

156
00:06:05,179 --> 00:06:07,359
So just don't try and do it through a windshield,

157
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:10,679
sunglasses, or a window.

158
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,279
It's just not going to work.

159
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:13,100
Get outside.

160
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,920
If the weather is really bad or for whatever reason,

161
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,679
safety reasons, you cannot get outside.

162
00:06:16,679 --> 00:06:18,480
Well, then I suppose try and get near a window.

163
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,540
That would be the last, last resort,

164
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,480
but you really want to get outside

165
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,940
to get the sunlight exposure.
